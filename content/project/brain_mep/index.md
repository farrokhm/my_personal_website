title: (Brain-MEP) Miniaturized Electrical Pulse Generator for Brain
---
The project at hand aims particularly at developing a unique implantable device for responsive neurostimulation. The innovative approach utilized in this project will significantly increase A) acceptance and B) efficacy compared to the current devices. This innovative approach will result into the successful commercialization of the final product.
A)	Improved comfort, reduced implantation complexity/risks, and increased longevity due to: Miniaturization, placement of the device on the skull bone and wireless charging.<br />
B)	Optimization of therapy for individual patients through two novelties:
1. Responsive stimulation (closed-loop system): The implanted electrodes record the brain activity. A seizure detection algorithm (which is designed based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods) uses this information for monitoring the brain activity. As soon as a propagating seizure is detected, an electrical stimulation pulse is initiated to suppress the epileptic activity and therefor control the seizure. 
2. A software tool, which optimizes stimulation parameters for individual patients using AI-based clinical & mathematical models.<br />

Brain-MEP will initially be used for the treatment of epilepsy, and subsequently for other brain disorders to improve patients' quality of life.
