title: (Brain-MEP) Miniaturized Electrical Pulse Generator for Brain
---
The project aims at developing a unique implantable device for responsive neurostimulation. The innovative advancement significantly increases A) acceptance and B) efficacy compared to the state-of-the-art devices, which in turn enables successful commercialization.
A)	Improved comfort, reduced implantation complexity/risks, and increased longevity due to: Miniaturization, placement of the device on the skull bone and wireless charging.
B)	Optimization of therapy for individual patients through two novelties: 
1. Responsive stimulation (closed-loop system): The implanted electrodes record the brain activity. A seizure detection algorithm (which is designed based on artificial intelligence methods) uses this information for monitoring the brain activity. As soon as a propagating seizure is detected, an electrical stimulation is initiated to suppress the epileptic activity and control the seizure. 
2. A software tool which optimizes stimulation parameters for individual patients using AI-based clinical & mathematical models.
Brain-MEP will initially be used for the treatment of epilepsy, and subsequently for other brain disorders to improve patients' quality of life.
