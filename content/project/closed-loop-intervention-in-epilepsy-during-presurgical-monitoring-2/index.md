This project aimed at a realization of closed-loop interventions in a clinical setup with patients undergoing intracranial long-term EEG recordings. Main milestones were the implementation of seizure detection algorithms in an online fashion, integration of detections in an online access system and realization of triggered electrical stimulations in the zone of seizure onset, assessment of sensitivity and specificity of online detections and first experiences with stimulations at the site of seizure onset.
