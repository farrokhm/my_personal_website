As a biomedical engineer and dedicated data scientist, I am deeply passionate about leveraging data science to develop creative solutions. Throughout my academic journey, which includes both bachelor's and master's degrees, I developed a solid foundation in medical engineering, with a specialization in biosignal analysis. During my Ph.D., I further honed my expertise in machine learning, focusing particularly on its applications in brain-machine interfaces.<br>Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist, where I apply advanced analytics, machine learning techniques, and critical thinking to deliver impactful solutions across various industries. I am always eager to explore new opportunities that allow me to tackle challenging problems within my field, particularly those that can have a meaningful and positive impact.
